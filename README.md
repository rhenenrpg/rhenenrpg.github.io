## Welcome

This site is a Work-In-Progress.

Having been an avid Dungeon and Dragon player and gamemaster since my university years in the last millenium, with this site i aims to share withthe great community that considers TTRPG their hobby. Focus will be knowledge and subjects that i do not find detailed elsewhere on the internet. Do not expect professional writing nor frequent updates because i have a lot of time to spend, but not a lot to give.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rhenenrpg/rhenenrpg.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rhenenrpg/rhenenrpg.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
