## Welcome

This site is a Work-In-Progress.

Having been an avid Dungeon and Dragon player and gamemaster since my university years in the last millenium, with this site i aims to share withthe great community that considers TTRPG their hobby. Focus will be knowledge and subjects that i do not find detailed elsewhere on the internet. Do not expect professional writing nor frequent updates because i have a lot of time to spend, but not a lot to give.


[Multi-Gamemaster Multi-Player](/mgmp/README.md) - my rantings about technical solutions how to support this mode of play.
