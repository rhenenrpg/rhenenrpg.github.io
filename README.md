## Welcome

This site is a Work-In-Progress.

Having been an avid Dungeon and Dragon player and gamemaster since my university years in the last millenium, with this site i aim to share with the great community that considers TTRPG their hobby. Focus will be knowledge and subjects that i do not find detailed elsewhere on the internet. Do not expect professional writing nor frequent updates because this is a work-of-love, not a paid job.
