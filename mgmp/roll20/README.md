## Roll20 solution for Multi-GM Multi-Player 

The Roll20 solution for Multi-GM Multi-Player initiatives is Roll20 with some conventions and helper scripts.

A roll20 campaign acts as characterhub. Each GM uses own game(s) during game nights. Some GMs prefer a single game, other GMs like to make a game for each different adventure. Before a session the GM copies the participating characters to their own game using the character vault. After a session the GM administrates the fact that the character played in the characterhub and removes the characters from their own game.

### Characterhub

Characters are created and maintained in the characterhub. The Characterhub is created by someone with a Roll20 Pro subscription to ease exporting characters and running the [helper script](https://gist.github.com/MartijnSanders/072b9af2eea5d362cff5cac90eea4633).
