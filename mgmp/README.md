## Multi Gamemaster, Multi Player ##

Many people like to play in initiatives that are Multi Gamemaster, Multi Player. Popular initiaves that allow  a player to play and evolve the same character over multiple sessions. Initiatives like West-Marches, informal one shot collectives, GMs that connect there own world to a central adventure guild or even organized play sanctioned by WOTC, Paizo or another publisher.


This site describes two solutions. A [solution based on Roll20](roll20), which is currently used bij Frequent Freewheelers, an initiative with about 6 sessions per week. And a [Work-In-Progress solution for FoundryVTT](foundry) that I am setting up to support the cool kids that think Roll20 is too oldskool and FoundryVTT is the best.

Both solutions assume that out-of-game chat, lfg, voice and video calls take place via Discord.
