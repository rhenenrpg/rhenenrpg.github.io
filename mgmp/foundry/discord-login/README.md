When the gives permission, the website uses user username, servers and roles to determine whether the user is granted access to the site and which ACL groups to apply. Apart from the discord username and the discord user id none of the discord information is stored/kept on the website.

The logged in example user is assigned the groups to access the **tuesday campaign wiki** and it's associated **foundryvtt instance**, which currently has **Mad Biomancer's Tower** active. Links to the wiki and foundryvtt instance are shown on the start page.
