## My Foundry solution for Multi-GM Multi-Player

*Note: on this site the solution is explicitly named 'my' foundry solution. The use of 'my' is not because this solution is the best,
but to avoid discussions and opinions with zealous know-it-all internet trolls (you know who you are!). 
There are many ways a solution can be composed, but this is the solution that i have chosen. 
The reasoning for some choices is shared for educational/comical purposes.*


Note: this solution is a Work In Progress, the [hosting part of the solution](selfhosting.md) has just been finished. Many more features and functionalities have to be implemented yet.


Todo's: 
  * Character Hub: players can upload character tokens to a good location and CANNOT overwrite other players tokens
  * Character Hub: players can import character from dndbeyond
  * Character Hub: apply naming convention for actors or facilitate actor selection by player
  * Character Hub: apply token lighting standards
  * Character transport: copy over actor from hub to play game (including token etc)
  * Play game access control: easy to give gms and players access
