## My Foundry solution for Multi-GM Multi-Player

*Note: on this site the solution is explicitly named 'my' foundry solution. The use of 'my' is not because this solution is the best,
but to avoid discussions and opinions with zealous know-it-all internet trolls (you know who you are!). 
There are many ways a solution can be composed, but this is the solution that i have chosen. 
The reasoning for some choices is shared for educational/comical purposes.*


Note: this solution is a Work In Progress, the [hosting part of the solution](selfhosting.md) has just been finished. Many more features and functionalities have to be implemented yet.


Todo's: 
  * Character Hub: players can upload character tokens to a good location and CANNOT overwrite other players tokens
  * Character Hub: players can link to characters on dndbeyond
  * Character Hub: players can import character from dndbeyond
  * Character Hub: apply naming convention for actors or facilitate actor selection by player
  * Character Hub: apply token lighting standards
  * Character transport: copy over actor from hub to play game (including token etc)
  * Play game access control: it should be easy and quick to give gms and players access


Note: This endeavour has been halted for now. Reasons for this are:
  * What i want to achieve requires weeks of dedicated development effort, in my broken brain i do not have this bandwith available.
  * Modules often do not take routeprefix into account and assume the foundryvtt instance is hosted without routeprefix. I do not mind contributing - and did multiple times, but each contribution implies a distraction
  * Rate of change of foundryvtt. Foundryvtt is relentless in it's development choices. The percentage of abandoned modules is horrendous. The need for a League of Extraordinary Developers is a Sign. As i see it, the only modules that will survive will be modules with a paid subscription support - which defeats the premise that FoundryVTT only requires a one-time payment. If i ask people that use FoundryVTT, most of the them use an older version that works for them and do not upgrade.
  * Community or Cult? For now I left the FoundryVTT related discords, because... how shall i put it... at this moment the communication and chats feel - to me - more like a creepy cult than a warm welcoming community. For example: i asked a question and within an hour three badged moderators turned the answer into a scene from Life of Brian where three temple guards where topping each other in their knowledge about intentions of the the scriptures (license agreement).
